        <p>Most economists are in agreement that the inflation in the United States during the past three years has been the worst since the early 1940′s, taking account of both severity and duration. But they cannot agree on the nature of the inflation that is engulfing the American economy. To some, inflation denotes a spectacular rise in consumer prices; to others, an excessive aggregate demand; and to at least one economist, it is the creation of new money by our monetary authorities. This disagreement among economists is more than an academic difference on the meaning of a popular term. It reflects professional confusion as to the cause of the inflation problem and the policies that might help to correct it. A review of some basic principles of economics that are applicable to money may shed light on the problem. Two basic questions need to be answered: (1) What are the factors that originally afforded value to money, and (2) What are the factors that effect changes in the “objective exchange value of money” or its purchasing power? Money is a medium of exchange that facilitates trade in goods and services. Wherever people progressed beyond simple barter, they began to use their most marketable goods as media of exchange. In primitive societies they used cattle, or measures of grain, salt, or fish. In early civilizations where the division of labor extended to larger areas, gold or silver emerged as the most marketable good and finally as the only medium of exchange, called money. It is obvious that the chieftains, kings, and heads of state did not invent the use of money. But they frequently usurped control over it whenever they suffered budget deficits and could gain revenue from currency debasement. When an economic good is sought and wanted, not only for its use in consumption or production but also for purposes of exchange, to be held in reserve for later exchanges, the demand for it obviously increases. We may then speak of two partial demands which combine to raise its value in exchange—its purchasing power.(Article source:https://fee.org/articles/the-value-of-money/ )</p>

    <h1>GMO Food</h1>
    <p>Genetically modified foods or GM foods, also known as genetically engineered foods or bioengineered foods, are foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering. Genetic engineering techniques allow for the introduction of new traits as well as greater control over traits than previous methods such as selective breeding and mutation breeding. Commercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994, when Celgene first marketed its unsuccessful Flavr Savr delayed-ripening tomato. Most food modifications have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean, corn, canola, and cotton. Genetically modified crops have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and for better nutrient profiles. GM livestock have been developed, although as of November 2013 none were on the market. There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.</p>

    <h1>The View of World in 2100</h1>
    <p>The Internet will be in your contact lens. Imagine blinking, and then instantly going on line, accessing your home office, or home entertainment system anywhere or anytime. We will be able to download any movie, song, Web site, or piece of information off the Internet directly onto our Internet-enabled contact lenses. These lenses will also be able to identify people’s faces, translate their comments and provide subtitles, so that we will always know exactly with whom we are speaking and what they are saying in any language. We will live in a cross between “The Matrix” and real life. Tourists will love this, for example, since they will be able to see the glory of the Roman Empire resurrected in their contact lens as they walk among the ruins of Rome. Artists and architects will love it, as well, since they will be able to create great works of art by simply moving their hands in the air. People suffering from illnesses, like diabetes, will love it, too, because they will have immediate readouts of their heart rate, insulin levels, and other important conditions within their own bodies.</p>
